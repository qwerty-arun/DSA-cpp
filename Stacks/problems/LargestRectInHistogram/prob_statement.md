# Largest Rectangle in Histogram (LeetCode 84)
- Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1
- Return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram
- heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
- Output: 10
- The 5 and 6 form a big rectangle of area: min(5,6) * (1+1) = 5*2 = 10

# Merge Sort Algorithm
- Based on recursion and backtracking
- arr[] = {12, 31, 35, 8, 32, 17}
- Divide and Conquer

## Steps
- Divide the array in 2 equal parts
- [12,31,35] and [8,32,17], then [12,31] and [35] & [8,32] and [17], then [12] [31] [8] [32]
- Then from the bottom, merge the arrays in sorted manner and come back up

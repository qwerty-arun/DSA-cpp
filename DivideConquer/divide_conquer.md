# Divide and Conquer
- Divide the main problem into subproblems, solve them individually and then merge them to find solution to original problem

## Characteristics
- Dividing the problem into more manageable subproblems which are simple enough to solve directly
- Independence of Subproblems: solving one subproblem doesn't depend on the solution of another.
- Conquer: Solve the subproblems individually.
- Combining Solutions: All solutions are combined

## Examples
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Strassen's Algorithm: Multiply two matrices in O(n^2.8974)
- Karatsuba Algorithm: Multiply two binary strings in O(n^1.59) where n is the length of binary string
- Closest Pair of points
- Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm

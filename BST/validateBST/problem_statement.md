# Validate Binary Search Tree (Leetcode: 98)
- Given the root of binary tree, determine if it is a BST
## A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs
- In other words: left tree max value < node->vale < right tree min value
